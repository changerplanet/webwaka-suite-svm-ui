✅ PHASE 2 — REPLIT EXECUTION PROMPT

WebWaka SVM UI (Clean-Slate, Constitution-Compliant)

⸻

CONTEXT (READ FIRST — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You are executing Phase 2 of the WebWaka SVM UI rebuild.

This repository was intentionally recreated and contains ONLY a README.md.
That is correct and expected.

Your previous behavior of auto-creating placeholder UI files was incorrect for this project.

This task requires strict procedural execution.

⸻

🚫 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS (HARD STOP CONDITIONS)

If ANY of the following occur, you MUST STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask for clarification:
	•	❌ Auto-scaffolding a UI because the repo is empty
	•	❌ Creating placeholder HTML, static pages, or demo apps
	•	❌ Creating replit.md automatically
	•	❌ Running a dev server before explicit instruction
	•	❌ Committing or pushing any file before Phase 2 instructions are complete
	•	❌ Assuming UI structure, routes, or components
	•	❌ Using USD ($) anywhere (Nigeria-first rule)

If the repository is empty → WAIT.
Empty repo ≠ permission to scaffold.

⸻

SOURCE OF TRUTH (IMMUTABLE)
	•	Repository: changerplanet/webwaka-suite-svm-ui
	•	Branch: main
	•	Control Layers (MANDATORY CONSUMPTION):
	•	webwaka-suite-svm-control
	•	webwaka-core-dashboard-control
	•	Constitution: WebWaka Ecosystem Constitution v1.5+

All visibility, access, and navigation decisions must flow through Phase 4A control engines.

⸻

PHASE 2 OBJECTIVE

Build the WebWaka SVM UI as:
	•	A pure UI consumer
	•	Fully declarative
	•	Nigeria-first (₦ only)
	•	Deterministic
	•	Offline-capable
	•	Control-driven (no hardcoded permissions)

⸻

REQUIRED EXECUTION SEQUENCE (STRICT ORDER)

1️⃣ CLONE & VERIFY (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
	1.	Clone the repository from GitHub.
	2.	Verify contents:
	•	✅ README.md exists
	•	❌ No app code exists
	3.	DO NOT CREATE ANY FILES YET
	4.	Explicitly acknowledge:

“Repository verified empty as expected. Awaiting Phase 2 build instructions.”

⸻

2️⃣ INITIALIZE PROJECT (ONLY AFTER VERIFICATION)

After confirmation, initialize exactly:
	•	Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
	•	Language: TypeScript
	•	Styling: Tailwind CSS
	•	Testing: Jest + React Testing Library

⚠️ No demo data
⚠️ No placeholder UI
⚠️ No sample currency values

⸻

3️⃣ CURRENCY & LOCALE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
	•	Currency: Nigerian Naira (₦) ONLY
	•	Locale: en-NG
	•	Any numeric values shown must be:
	•	Mocked
	•	Explicitly labeled as Sample
	•	Formatted in ₦

USD is constitutionally forbidden.

⸻

4️⃣ CONTROL LAYER CONSUMPTION (MANDATORY)

You MUST consume:
	•	webwaka-suite-svm-control
	•	webwaka-core-dashboard-control

Create one and only one control entry point:

src/lib/control-consumer.ts

No other file may import control packages directly.

UI visibility must be driven by:
	•	resolveDashboard
	•	Snapshot evaluation
	•	No local gating logic

⸻

5️⃣ UI SCOPE (DO NOT EXPAND)

Implement only:
	•	Layout
	•	Navigation
	•	Section containers
	•	Snapshot-driven rendering

❌ No business logic
❌ No backend APIs
❌ No payments
❌ No pricing logic

⸻

6️⃣ TESTING & VERIFICATION (REQUIRED)

Before committing:
	•	✅ npm test passes
	•	✅ Determinism test (10× same output)
	•	✅ Snapshot integrity test
	•	✅ No hardcoded permissions/flags
	•	✅ No USD anywhere

⸻

7️⃣ COMMIT & PUSH (FINAL STEP)
	•	Single clean commit
	•	Message:

Phase 5C SVM UI — Constitution-Compliant Initial Implementation


	•	Push to main
	•	Do NOT create branches

⸻

HARD STOP

After push:

⛔ STOP
⛔ Do NOT add features
⛔ Do NOT scaffold further
⛔ Await Manus verification

⸻

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT REQUIRED

Reply only with:

“Acknowledged. Repo will be treated as intentionally empty. No scaffolding will occur until instructed.”

Then proceed.
