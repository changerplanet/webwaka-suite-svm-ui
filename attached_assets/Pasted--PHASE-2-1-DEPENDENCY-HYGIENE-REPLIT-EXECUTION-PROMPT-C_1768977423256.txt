🔐 PHASE 2.1 — DEPENDENCY HYGIENE (REPLIT EXECUTION PROMPT)

CONTEXT (READ CAREFULLY)

You are executing Phase 2.1 — Dependency Hygiene for:

Repository:
changerplanet/webwaka-suite-svm-ui

This phase exists solely to address a known development-dependency security advisory identified during Phase 2 ratification.

This is a HYGIENE PATCH, not feature work.

⸻

🚫 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You MUST NOT:
	•	❌ Add or change any UI behavior
	•	❌ Modify dashboard structure or layout
	•	❌ Touch permissions, entitlements, or feature flags
	•	❌ Add new dependencies unrelated to the advisory
	•	❌ Change architecture or control-layer integration points
	•	❌ Introduce new features, mocks, or stubs
	•	❌ Silence or downgrade security tooling

Any violation = constitutional breach

⸻

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Resolve the development-dependency security advisory:
	•	Advisory: glob command injection (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2)
	•	Scope: Development dependencies only
	•	Entry path: eslint-config-next
	•	Runtime impact: NONE

After completion:
	•	npm audit --audit-level=high must return clean
	•	npm run build must pass
	•	npm test must pass
	•	No behavioral or architectural changes introduced

⸻

📌 REQUIRED PRECONDITION (MANDATORY)

Before doing anything else:
	1.	CLONE THE REPOSITORY

git clone https://github.com/changerplanet/webwaka-suite-svm-ui.git


	2.	Confirm:
	•	Branch: main
	•	Clean working tree
	•	No uncommitted changes

If cloning fails → STOP and report

⸻

✅ REQUIRED ACTIONS (STEP BY STEP)

1️⃣ Identify Vulnerable Dependency Path
	•	Run:

npm audit --audit-level=high


	•	Confirm vulnerability originates from:
	•	glob
	•	via eslint-config-next
	•	Capture the dependency tree mentally (no screenshots required)

⸻

2️⃣ Apply Minimal Safe Upgrade

You must:
	•	Upgrade only what is necessary to remove the advisory
	•	Prefer:
	•	npm update
	•	or targeted version bump in package.json
	•	Do not replace tooling (no eslint removal, no framework swap)

The goal is removal, not redesign.

⸻

3️⃣ Re-install Cleanly

After changes:

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

This ensures:
	•	No cached vulnerable versions
	•	Lockfile reflects the fix

⸻

4️⃣ Verify Hygiene (MANDATORY)

Run all of the following:

npm audit --audit-level=high
npm test
npm run build
npm run lint

All must pass with:
	•	Exit code 0
	•	No masked failures
	•	No new warnings introduced

⸻

🔍 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (YOU MUST SELF-VERIFY)

Before committing, confirm:
	•	✅ No source files changed (only dependency files)
	•	✅ No UI files modified
	•	✅ No control-layer files touched
	•	✅ No new vulnerabilities introduced
	•	✅ No dependency removed unnecessarily

⸻

📦 COMMIT REQUIREMENTS
	•	Commit message (EXACT FORMAT):

chore(security): resolve dev dependency advisory (glob)


	•	Files allowed to change:
	•	package.json
	•	package-lock.json
	•	NOTHING else

⸻

📄 REQUIRED FINAL REPORT (IN CHAT)

After pushing to main, report only the following:

Phase 2.1 Dependency Hygiene — COMPLETE

✔ npm audit --audit-level=high: clean
✔ npm test: pass
✔ npm run build: pass
✔ npm run lint: pass

Changed files:
- package.json
- package-lock.json

No behavioral or architectural changes introduced.


⸻

⛔ HARD STOP

After submitting the report:

⛔ STOP
⛔ Do NOT proceed to Phase 3
⛔ Await formal re-verification and authorization

⸻

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORMAT (REQUIRED)

Reply only with:

“Phase 2.1 acknowledged. Proceeding with dependency hygiene exactly as instructed.”

Then execute.
